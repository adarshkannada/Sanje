<p align = "justify">This is the first intro post written on this blog. I will be testing further posts on this and then finalize the blog soon.</p>
<p align = "justify"> I also need to find out how to implement tech.acchakannada.com, a subdomain for our Main blog using jekyll subdomains. For Now it just seems that i just need to add a CNAME to my new blog site and would create the subdomain. But still i need to find out if there is anything additional steps that are required to set up he new blog. <p>
